### Security

## [v1.2.1]

### Fixed

- Rainbow no longer provides announcements of blocks via Bitswap. This is not needed to provide blocks to peers with `RAINBOW_PEERING_SHARED_CACHE`.
- Rainbow no longer keeps track of other peer's Bitswap wantlists. It will only reply if they have the block at the moment. This should reduce the processing and memory usage.

## [v1.2.0]

### Added

- ✨ Now supports automatic peering with peers that have the same seed via `--seed-peering` (`RAINBOW_SEED_PEERING`). You can further read how this works in [`docs/environment-variables.md`](docs/environment-variables.md).

## [v1.1.0]

### Added

- ✨ Now supports local cache sharing with peers provided via `--peering` (`RAINBOW_PEERING`). You can further read how this works in [`docs/environment-variables.md`](docs/environment-variables.md).

## [v1.0.0]

Our first version. Check the [README](README.md) for all the information regarding 🌈 Rainbow.
