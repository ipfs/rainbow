### Security

## [v1.7.0]

### Added

- Ability to specify the maximum blocksize that bitswap will replace WantHave with WantBlock responses, and to disable replacement when set to zero. [#165](https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow/pull/165)
- Support use and configuration of pebble as [datastore](https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow/blob/main/docs/blockstores.md). Pebble provides a high-performance alternative to badger. Options are available to configure key tuning parameters (`pebble-*` in `rainbow --help`).

## [v1.6.0]

### Added

### Changed

- Updated Go in go.mod to 1.22
- Updated dependencies
  - go-libp2p [0.36.3](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.36.3)
  - go-libp2p-kad-dht [0.26.1](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/releases/tag/v0.26.1)
  - boxo [0.23.0](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.23.0)
  - badger [4.3.0](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/releases/tag/v4.3.0)

### Fixed

- a bug whereby `FindPeer` won't return results for peers behind NAT which only have `/p2p-circuit` multiaddrs [go-libp2p-kad-dht#976](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/976)

## [v1.5.0]

### Added

- Simple end-to-end test to check that trustless-gateway-domains are set correctly. [#151](https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow/pull/151) [#157](https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow/pull/157)
- HTTP API to dynamically list logging subsystems and modify logging levels for subsystems. [#156](https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow/pull/156)

### Changed

- go-libp2p [0.36.1](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.36.1)
- boxo [0.22.0](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.22.0)

### Fixed

- [libp2p identify agentVersion](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/identify/README.md#agentversion) correctly indicates rainbow version when shared host is not used

## [v1.4.0]

### Added

- Tracing per request with auth header (see `RAINBOW_TRACING_AUTH`) or a fraction of requests (see `RAINBOW_SAMPLING_FRACTION`)
- Debugging with [`Rainbow-No-Blockcache`](./docs/headers.md#rainbow-no-blockcache) that is gated by the `Authorization` header and does not use the local block cache for the request

### Changed

- go-libp2p 0.35
- boxo 0.21

### Fixed

- Added more buckets to the duration histogram metric to allow for tracking operations that take longer than 1 minute.
- Release version included in `--version` output.

## [v1.3.0]

### Added

- Now supports remote backends (using RAW block or CAR requests) via `--remote-backends` (`RAINBOW_REMOTE_BACKENDS`).
- Added configurable libp2p listen addresses for the Bitswap host via the `libp2p-listen-addrs` flag and `RAINBOW_LIBP2P_LISTEN_ADDRS` environment variable

## [v1.2.2]

### Fixed

- Rainbow no longer initializes Bitswap server by default, restoring behavior from v1.0.0.

## [v1.2.1]

### Fixed

- Rainbow no longer provides announcements of blocks via Bitswap. This is not needed to provide blocks to peers with `RAINBOW_PEERING_SHARED_CACHE`.
- Rainbow no longer keeps track of other peer's Bitswap wantlists. It will only reply if they have the block at the moment. This should reduce the processing and memory usage.

## [v1.2.0]

### Added

- âœ¨ Now supports automatic peering with peers that have the same seed via `--seed-peering` (`RAINBOW_SEED_PEERING`). You can further read how this works in [`docs/environment-variables.md`](docs/environment-variables.md).

## [v1.1.0]

### Added

- âœ¨ Now supports local cache sharing with peers provided via `--peering` (`RAINBOW_PEERING`). You can further read how this works in [`docs/environment-variables.md`](docs/environment-variables.md).

## [v1.0.0]

Our first version. Check the [README](README.md) for all the information regarding ðŸŒˆ Rainbow.
